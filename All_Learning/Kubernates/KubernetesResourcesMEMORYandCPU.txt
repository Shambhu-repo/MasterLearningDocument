MEMORY:
request: -> required memory to startup the application
limit: maximum memory can be consumed
target : -> this is less than request ( when memory reach near to request and still application not starting then hpa will auto scale for memory)

CPU:
request : required memory to process the applicaiton startup
limit: maximum cpu (core or milicore) can be used
target : less thna request ( eg. if 800m milicore cpu as request then if target is 80% meaning -> 800x80/100 = 640m milicore is target . if processing exceeds 640m of cup then hpa autoscale
