not able to integrate with mysql and springboot application

-- >we deploy mysql in kubernetes
kubectl exec -it <mysql pods>  /bin/bash   -- > it will take to mysql pod execution mode
---- > 
then :
mysql -h mysql -u root -p        -- > it will ask password to get connectio (note sometimee -h gives error so no need to mention in some case)
show databases ;     			--> it will show databases
